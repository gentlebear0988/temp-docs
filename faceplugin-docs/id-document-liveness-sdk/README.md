# Liveness

### Overview

**Faceplugin ID Document Liveness SDK** checks whether the image is a **physical ID** or an attack: a screen replay, a printout, a digitally created page, or a substituted portrait.

This product does **not** read fields. OCR, MRZ (machine-readable zone), and barcodes are turned off. For **passport OCR plus authenticity** in one engine, use [ID Document Recognition](../id-document-recognition-sdk/) with a Liveness-capable license. This is **not** face anti-spoofing — use [Face Liveness Detection](../liveness-detection-sdk/) for selfies.

Today the public **SDK** is **Linux / Docker** (HTTP port **8086**). There is no public mobile SDK.

### Use Cases

* **KYC authenticity gate:** reject screen replays and printouts before you run OCR (`POST /api/documentLiveness`, port 8086).
* **Split architecture:** run authenticity checks on Linux while OCR runs in a separate service.
* **Fraud prevention:** confirm a physical ID is present without reading any personal fields.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**What is ID document liveness detection?**

It checks that a document image shows a real, physical ID rather than a screen replay, a printout, a digitally created page or a substituted portrait.

**Does the ID Document Liveness SDK read the MRZ or do OCR?**

No. OCR, MRZ and barcode reading are turned off. Use ID Document Recognition for OCR and MRZ.

**How do I call the document liveness API?**

Call `POST /api/documentLiveness` on port 8086 after activating with `POST /api/activate`. See [Linux SDK](id-document-liveness-linux-sdk.md).

**Is this the same as face liveness detection?**

No. This product checks ID documents. For selfie anti-spoofing, use Face Liveness Detection.

**Is there a mobile SDK for document liveness?**

Not publicly today. The SDK is available for Linux / Docker.

**Can I get OCR and authenticity checks together?**

Yes. Use ID Document Recognition with a liveness-capable license to get both from one engine.
