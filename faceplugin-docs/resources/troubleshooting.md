  Troubleshoot Faceplugin SDK demos. Missing AAR or frameworks, wrong app id licenses, Docker
  shm-size, Yarn 3 on React Native, and cameras that stay black on emulators.
---

# Troubleshooting

Start here when a Faceplugin demo never reaches **Ready**, the camera stays black, or HTTP process calls fail after Docker starts.

## Home never shows Ready / tiles stay locked

1. Native runtime missing or nested in a subfolder. Check the exact AAR / framework path in that App’s guide.
2. Wrong application id — demo `FP1.…` only matches the sample id.
3. `init` returned 1–4. See [Status codes](status-codes.md).
4. Called activate/init on the UI thread (Android) or before the binary was packaged (hot reload is not enough).

## Camera black / crash

Physical device, `CAMERA` permission / `NSCameraUsageDescription`, arm64. Document Reader and Face plugins often filter `arm64-v8a` only in the demo.

## Docker starts then process calls fail

Activate with `POST /api/activate`. Detached Compose does not prompt. `--shm-size` too small for Document Reader (`dcr.fpk`). Privileged + machine-id volume as in the README.

## `lib/cpu` “file not found”

You unzipped into `lib/cpu/FolderName/`. Files must sit **directly** in `cpu/`.

## React Native `npm install` broke the repo

Use **Yarn 3** as `packageManager`. npm workspaces are not supported at the root.

## Ionic / Flutter in the browser

`ionic serve` and Flutter web do not load the engine. Open Android Studio / Xcode after `cap sync` / `flutter run`.

## Two products in one APK / one `lib/`

Do not copy two products’ Google Drive runtimes into one folder. See [Combining products](choose-a-product.md#combining-products-ekyc).

## Still stuck

Email [info@faceplugin.com](mailto:info@faceplugin.com) with: OS, App repo, activate/init code, and whether you used Docker or Drive.
