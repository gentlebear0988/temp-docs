# Glossary

Short definitions for terms used across Faceplugin docs. For product choice, see [Choose a product](choose-a-product.md). For common questions, see [FAQ](faq.md).

## Products and flows

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Face Recognition** | Detect faces, extract a face **template**, and compare faces (1:1 or mobile 1:N). |
| **Face Liveness** | Face **anti-spoofing** — is the camera seeing a live person, or a photo/screen/mask? |
| **ID Document Recognition** (Document Reader) | Classify and read ID documents (passport OCR, MRZ, barcode, optional authenticity). |
| **ID Document Liveness** | Document **authenticity only** (no OCR) — is the ID image a real card or a spoof? |
| **eKYC** | Electronic know-your-customer / digital identity onboarding. Usually: scan ID → check authenticity → selfie liveness → face match. |
| **On-premise / offline** | After license activation, inference runs on **your** device or server — not a Faceplugin cloud API. |

## Matching and anti-spoofing

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **1:1** | Compare two faces (or two templates) — “is this the same person?” |
| **1:N Identify** | Compare one face against **many** enrolled templates. On mobile, Face Recognition demos do this with VideoWorker. The server HTTP API has **no** built-in gallery — you store templates and call `/api/similarity`. |
| **Template / embedding** | Numeric face feature vector from `templateExtraction` / `POST /api/feature`. You store it in **your** database. |
| **Similarity / match score** | How alike two templates (or images) are. Mobile Identify default match threshold **0.67**. |
| **Passive liveness** | Anti-spoofing **without** a smile / turn-head challenge. Score a frame or JPEG. |
| **Active liveness** | User must follow a challenge (smile, turn head). Faceplugin’s Face Liveness product is **passive**. Separate active demos exist on GitHub but are not the Face Liveness SDK. |
| **PAD** | Presentation-attack detection — another name for face (or document) anti-spoofing. |
| **Liveness score** | Face Liveness: score **≥ 0.5** → Real / pass (default in these docs). |

## Documents

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **OCR** | Optical character recognition — reading printed text from the ID image. |
| **MRZ** | Machine-readable zone — the two or three lines of characters at the bottom of many passports and some IDs. |
| **Document template** | A known ID layout the engine can classify (Faceplugin catalogs **16,900** templates / **255** countries). |
| **Document authenticity** | Checks that the ID image is a physical document (not a screen reprint, etc.). Needs a Liveness-capable license on Document Recognition, or the Document Liveness product. |

## Licensing and servers

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **`FP1.…`** | License key string for activation (mobile app id / bundle id, or server after you send a machine code). |
| **`FPMC1.…`** | Server **machine code** from `GET /api/machinecode`. Docker and a native host on the same PC produce **different** codes. |
| **Google Drive runtime** | Large native binaries (AAR, frameworks, `.so` / `.dll`, `.fpk`) linked from each platform page — not stored on GitHub. |
| **Port 8082** | ID Document Recognition HTTP API |
| **Port 8083** | Face Recognition HTTP API (combined Recognition + Liveness also uses 8083 and adds `/api/liveness`) |
| **Port 8084** | Face Liveness HTTP API |
| **Port 8086** | ID Document Liveness HTTP API |

## Standards (as used in these docs)

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **NIST FRVT** | Face Recognition Vendor Test — Faceplugin Face Recognition is described as **evaluated** on FRVT. |
| **iBeta** | Independent biometric testing lab often cited for liveness. These docs **do not** claim iBeta certification; ask Faceplugin for a certification statement if you need one. |
