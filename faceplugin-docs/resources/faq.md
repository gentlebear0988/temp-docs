# FAQ

## What can Faceplugin Document Reader do?

On-premise **passport OCR**, **MRZ reading**, ID card and driver license verification, barcode/QR, document type classification (**16,900** templates / **255** countries), and optional document authenticity. See [Document capabilities](../id-document-recognition-sdk/capabilities.md) and [Passport OCR & ID verification](passport-ocr-and-id-verification.md).

## Is Faceplugin a passport OCR SDK / MRZ reader?

Yes. The ID Document Recognition SDK reads passports and MRZ (when the template includes one), plus national IDs and licenses. HTTP API on port **8082**.

## What is a face recognition SDK?

A library that detects faces, extracts a template (embedding), and compares templates. Faceplugin’s commercial SDK runs **on-premise**. You store templates in **your** database. See [Face Recognition capabilities](../face-recognition-sdk/capabilities.md).

## Is there a Face Recognition API?

Yes — Linux Docker and Windows HTTP on port **8083** (`/api/detect`, `/match`, `/similarity`). The combined Recognition + Liveness packages also expose `/api/liveness` on the same port. Details: [Face Recognition capabilities](../face-recognition-sdk/capabilities.md).

## What is passive liveness detection?

The engine scores a camera frame or JPEG **without** a smile / turn-head challenge. Faceplugin’s [Face Liveness Detection SDK](../liveness-detection-sdk/capabilities.md) is **passive** anti-spoofing. These docs describe performance in iBeta Level 2 terms; contact Faceplugin if you need a specific certification claim.

## What is the difference between active and passive liveness?

**Passive:** no user challenge—used in the Face Liveness SDK and in Face Recognition’s Identify mode. **Active:** separate GitHub demos with smile/turn prompts (`Active-Liveness-Detection-Android` / `-iOS`); they are **not** the Face Liveness SDK. Face Liveness on Linux/Windows is still `POST /api/liveness` on one JPEG.

## Face Recognition liveness vs Face Liveness SDK?

Identify on mobile includes **2D liveness** as part of matching. The Face Liveness product is **anti-spoofing only** (no enroll / 1:N). See [Face Liveness capabilities](../liveness-detection-sdk/capabilities.md).

## Can face recognition work completely offline?

Yes. After you activate with an `FP1.…` key bound to the app id (mobile) or machine code (server), matching does not need the internet.

## Can Faceplugin run on-premise?

Yes. That is the product model: phone, Windows/Linux host, or Docker on **your** infrastructure.

## Does the Faceplugin SDK require an internet connection?

Not for inference after activation. You need a network only to clone GitHub, pull Docker Hub, download Drive runtimes, and to contact Faceplugin for a license.

## Does Faceplugin support Flutter?

Yes for Face Recognition and ID Document Recognition (`face_recognition_sdk`, `document_reader_sdk`). There is **no** public Face Liveness Flutter SDK — use Face Recognition’s 2D liveness on Identify and/or native Android/iOS Liveness.

## Does Faceplugin support iOS?

Yes for Face Recognition, Face Liveness, and ID Document Recognition. Physical iPhone; demo bundle ids are listed on each iOS page.

## How many ID document types are supported?

**16,900** templates across **255** countries and territories. Download the [Supported documents PDF](../id-document-recognition-sdk/capabilities.md#document-type-classification--worldwide-coverage).

## Docker vs host machine code

`GET /api/machinecode` returns `FPMC1.…`. Docker and a native host on the same machine produce **different** codes. License the environment you run in production. See [Request a License](../request-a-license-and-support.md).

## Demo `FP1.…` and my own app id

Sample keys are bound to the **demo** application id / bundle id on the platform page. Request a new key for your production id.

## Match and liveness thresholds

Mobile Identify default match **0.67**. Face Liveness server: score **≥ 0.5** → Real / pass. Change these defaults only if Faceplugin support gives you different recommended thresholds for your license.

## How large is the Android SDK?

The GitHub repo is small. Native models (AAR + `.fpk` / engine) come from Google Drive and are large — that is why they are not on GitHub. Check the Drive folder size for the product you licensed.

## Is there a Node.js or C++ SDK?

Document Reader has public Node / Go / C++ HTTP options. Face server integration is primarily HTTP (`curl` from any language) or Python `sdk.py` on the same host as `lib/cpu/`. See [Choose a product](choose-a-product.md).
