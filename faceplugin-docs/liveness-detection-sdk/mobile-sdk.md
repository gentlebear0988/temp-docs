  Faceplugin Face Liveness Detection Mobile SDK. On-premise anti-spoofing for
  Android and iOS. Passive liveness against photos, screens, 3D masks, and
  deepfakes.

# Mobile

Standalone presentation-attack detection on Android and iOS. The demo scores whether the face is **real**. It does not enroll people or run 1:N search.

Live camera (VideoWorker plus `faceDetection`). Score **0.5 or higher** is treated as Real / pass.

If you already use Face Recognition Identify on mobile, that flow already includes **passive 2D liveness**. Choose this product when you need anti-spoofing **without** enrollment.

For JPEG-over-HTTP on Windows, Linux, and Docker, use [Server SDK](server-sdk.md).

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Is this active or passive liveness detection?**

Passive. There is no smile, head-turn or other challenge. The SDK scores a camera frame and returns real or spoof.

**What attacks does the mobile liveness SDK detect?**

Printed photos, screen replays, 3D masks and deepfakes.

**What score counts as a real face?**

A liveness score of 0.5 or higher is treated as Real (pass).

**Does the SDK do face recognition too?**

No. It is anti-spoofing only, with no enrollment or 1:N search. For recognition plus liveness, use the Face Recognition Mobile SDK.

**Does it work offline?**

Yes. Liveness detection runs entirely on the device.
