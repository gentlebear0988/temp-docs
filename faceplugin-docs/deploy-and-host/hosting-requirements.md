# Hosting requirements

Use this page to size a host for Faceplugin **server** SDKs. Numbers match the public App README system requirement tables. Do not invent higher figures than those tables.

All shipping server products are **CPU only**. There is no `lib/gpu/` package in these apps.

**shm** means Docker shared memory (`--shm-size`). Document products need enough shm to unpack model packs such as `dcr.fpk`.

## Ports

| Product | API port | Gradio (host only) | Docker image | Role |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| ID Document Recognition + Liveness | 8082 | 9002 | `faceplugin/document-reader` | **Recommended** for OCR + authenticity |
| Face Recognition + Liveness | 8083 | 9003 | `faceplugin/face-recognition-liveness-sdk` | **Recommended** for match + face PAD |
| Face Recognition (only) | 8083 | 9003 | `faceplugin/face-recognition` | Match only — no `/api/liveness` |
| Face Liveness (only) | 8084 | 9004 | `faceplugin/face-liveness` | PAD only — use when you do not need match |
| ID Document Liveness (only) | 8086 | 9006 | `faceplugin/document-liveness` | Authenticity only — use when you do not need OCR |

Gradio is for local demos. Do not expose it in production. See [Production deployment](production-deployment.md).

Prefer the **combined** Face and Document images for eKYC so you do not run separate recognition and liveness containers. Details: [Architecture](architecture.md).

## Per-product sizing

| Product | Min CPU | Min RAM | Min disk | Recommended | OS notes | Docker extras |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Face Recognition + Liveness | 2 cores | 4 GB | 4 GB | 4 cores / 8 GB RAM / 8 GB disk | Docker: Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04. Native Linux needs glibc **2.38+** (for example Ubuntu 24.04). Windows 10/11 x64 | `--shm-size=2gb --privileged`. On Linux mount `/etc/machine-id:ro` |
| Face Recognition (only) | 2 cores | 4 GB | 4 GB | 4 cores / 8 GB RAM / 8 GB disk | Same as combined | `--shm-size=2gb --privileged`. On Linux mount `/etc/machine-id:ro` |
| Face Liveness (only) | 2 cores (Linux) / 4 cores (Windows README) | 4 GB | 4 GB | 4 cores / 8 GB RAM / 8 GB disk | Same Docker OS guidance as Face Recognition. Windows 10/11 x64 | `--shm-size=1gb --privileged`. On Linux mount `/etc/machine-id:ro` |
| ID Document Recognition + Liveness | 2 cores | 4 GB | 4 GB | 4 cores / 8 GB RAM / 8 GB disk | Ubuntu 20.04+ x86_64; recommend 22.04 / 24.04. Windows 10/11 x64. CPU only | `--shm-size=2gb` is **required**. `--privileged`. On Linux mount `/etc/machine-id:ro` |
| ID Document Liveness (only) | 2 cores | 4 GB | 4 GB | 4 cores / 8 GB RAM / 8 GB disk | Align with Document Reader Linux | `--shm-size=2gb` is **required**. `--privileged`. On Linux mount `/etc/machine-id:ro` |

For a typical eKYC box, plan **two** containers: Document Reader (**8082**) + Face Recognition + Liveness (**8083**). Add RAM/CPU for each. Each container keeps its own `lib/cpu/` — do not mix product Drive folders. See [Architecture](architecture.md).

## Docker rules

* On **Docker Desktop** (macOS / Windows), omit the `/etc/machine-id` volume.
* On Linux Engine, mounting `/etc/machine-id` lets several containers on the same host share one machine code for licensing.
* A smaller `--shm-size` than required can crash Document Reader when `dcr.fpk` unpacks.
* Docker Hub images already include the runtime. You do not need Google Drive for Option A Hub pulls.

## Mobile devices

Mobile SDKs run on the phone. Prefer a **physical device** for camera work. Emulator cameras often stay black. See [Troubleshooting](../resources/troubleshooting.md).

This page does not invent phone RAM minimums beyond each platform README.
